#rv_semifl
A Remote Viewing semi-frontloader.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									A
Generates random remote viewing target co-ordinates from a list of targets in a text file.

#usage
For practise against a list of _known_ targets, simply type each target onto a new line: it is important to keep your list diverse - too many similar targets may allow your imagination to invent pictures to fill in the gaps of what it _expects_ to see and will cloud your results.

For investigative purposes for a solitary user, they can input a (ideally) long list of targets of
interest. Again, the more diversity in your targets: the better: so when you do to come to view, you will have an idea of the subject - but not exactly the target you had written.



# how I envison it'll work
<li>Form with a generate button (not unlike runes) - will also have a reveal button to reveal the target</li>
<li>reads from target.txt and picks a random line number and keeps the text from it
<li>generates random sequence
<li>append sequence + text from random line number to target-viewed.txt
<li>viewer makes note of number sequence and proceeds to remote view it
<li>after the session, they simply open target-viewed.txt in a text editor to see what their target was.
